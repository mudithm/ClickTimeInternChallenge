__Response to Question 1, _The Race Around the World___

This is a simple jquery-based stopwatch that incorporates both the stretch goals specified for this question.

You can run it as follows:

1. Download/clone this repository
2. From within the folder containing , start a python server with `python -m http.server <port>`
3. Navigate to the url `localhost:<port>`

Assumptions: I assumed that, whenever the start button is clicked, the start time (from which elapsed time is calculated) gets reset. Additionally, I assumed that clicking the stop button acts like the "lap" function on a stopwatch.
